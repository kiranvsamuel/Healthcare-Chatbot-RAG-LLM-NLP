AI based Healthcare RAG Chatbot Implementation using LLM, NLP and AI Search

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates retrieval-based methods with generative models by querying relevant knowledge bases & documents, synthesizing coherent, contextually accurate responses.

Combining RAG with Natural Language Processing (NLP) significantly enhances the efficiency and precision of LLM-based applications.

In healthcare, RAG's ability to access vast clinical literature or patient records ensures precise, informed responses in search solutions, chatbots, and research tools. This precision is essential for accurate medical advice, streamlined diagnoses, and evidence-based decisions, while reducing hallucinations typical in pure generative models.

Tried making a healthcare knowledge-based RAG system for Lupus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disease. The AI-driven semantic search (using Azure AI Search) leverages keyword search, scoring, and semantic ranking built from a document repository. The search retrieves relevant data, and an OpenAI LLM synthesizes prompts based on ranking to generate human-like responses. Additionally, an NLP model (Azure AI Speech) converts these outputs into voice responses for user interaction.

In healthcare research and knowledge-based systems, RAG extends the capabilities of LLMs to specific clinical domains without requiring retraining. It offers a cost-effective approach to ensuring LLM outputs remain relevant and accurate, bringing value to AI-powered search solutions.
